It will automate the complete process of ordering our grocery items from the website Natureâ€™s Basket. First, we will run a script on the website which will automatically add all the items in cart and will further end the address details of the user and will proceed to make the order. The script is written in NodeJS and uses Puppeteer, the popular browser automation library, based on Node.js, which provides a high-level API over the Chrome DevTools Protocol.   

Note: First install puppeteer before running the .bat file.  

How to install:  
npm install puppeteer
